Project completed by: Fatima Hararah, Kimsean Pen, Tuan Pham, Steve Stilson 

Project Description:
Each member of the team is assigned tasks to investigate and uncover insights within the objective outline. Upon completion of the analysis, each team member is expected to create a presentation slide(s) that includes findings derived from the data. The slides should provide information that addresses the objective investigation and incorporates data visualization to effectively communicate the insights gathered. 

Objective:

Examine and interpret compensation data to gain understanding of the variations in salary within data focused roles, including business analytics, data analytics, and data science. Additionally, we will investigate the differences in salaries between data - driven positions and non-data roles such as teacher, management, attorney and consultant. 

Identify pay differences between data focused roles in various states and compare them with pay differences in non-data roles to assess the influence of geographical location on salary variations for both data and non-data professionals to highlight regional compensation patterns across different industries.

Concentrating on salary compensation, we will examine the disparities between the salaries offered for data related position and the anticipated prevailing wages in the industry, with the aim to identify the toles that exhibit the most significant deviations from the expected remuneration
