Objective:

Examine and interpret compensation data to gain understanding of the variations in salary within data focused roles, including business analytics, data analytics, and data science. Additionally, we will investigate the differences in salaries between data - driven positions and non-data roles such as teacher, management, attorney and consultant. 

Identify pay differences between data focused roles in various states and compare them with pay differences in non-data roles to assess the influence of geographical location on salary variations for both data and non-data professionals to highlight regional compensation patterns across different industries.
