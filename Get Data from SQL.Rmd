## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(RMySQL)
library(DBI);
library(ggplot2)
remove(housingData);

con = dbConnect(
    drv = RMySQL::MySQL(),
    dbname = "phpmyadmin",
    host = "localhost",
    username = "root",
    password = ""
  )

rm (means);
means = data.frame(matrix(vector(), 0, 2, dimnames=list(c(), c('category','mean'))), stringsAsFactors=F);

# means[nrow(means)+1,] = result;
# means['A'] <- as.numeric(result); # c(result['A']);
# print(means);

dataList <- list("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","U","V","W","X","Y","Z","AA","BB","CC","DD","EE","FF","GG","HH","II","JJ","KK","LL","MM","NN","OO","PP");
for(category in dataList){
  sql = paste("SELECT COLLEGE_MAJOR_CODE, avg(PAID_WAGE_SUBMITTED) FROM salaries.salary_data_states_2 where `COLLEGE_MAJOR_CODE` = '", category, "';",sep="", collapse="");
  print(sql);
  result <- dbGetQuery(con, sql);

  means[nrow(means)+1,] = result;
}
```

## Plot

```{r}
means2 <- means[order(means$mean), ];
# means2 %>% ggplot(aes(x = category, y = mean)) +
ggplot(means2, aes(x = category, y = mean)) +
  # geom_jitter() +
  # geom_line() +
  geom_hex( bins=30 ) +
  labs(  # annotations layer
    title = "Salary averages by college major",
    y = "Average salary"
  )

```
