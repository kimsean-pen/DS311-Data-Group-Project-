This finding is consistent with the fact that San Francisco is widely recognized as a prominent \"Tech Hub\", suggesting that a high concentration of tech related jobs in Califoria may contribute to its top ranking. North Carolina and New Jersey follow in second and third place with an average salary of 105,477.0 and 103,500.0 respectively. \n",
